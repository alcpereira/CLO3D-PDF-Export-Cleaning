# CLO3D-PDF-Export-Cleaning
Illustrator script to clean CLO3D's PDF Export

# What it does
- Release and remove Clipping Masks
- Delete all the Paths with no strokes: Clip paths, fabric fill (duplicate of the fabric contour)
- Delete Blue lines (to identify, but it seems like a reference when using Pattern Outline)
- Corrects the Sewing Allowance color (grey to black)
- Sets the Stroke width to 1pt (can be changed)

# TODO
- Readme: How to install
- Removing duplicates notches
